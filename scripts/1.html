Her husband, Arjun, stood by her side, his hand trembling slightly as he reached out to touch the baby’s cheek.</p><p>“She’s so perfect,” Arjun whispered, his voice cracking with emotion.</p><p>The baby stirred, her tiny fingers unfurling like petals of a flower. Anjali watched as those delicate fingers wrapped tightly around Arjun’s thumb. In that moment, the world outside the room disappeared. It was just the three of them, bound together in a love so profound it was almost overwhelming.</p><p></p><p>The first night at home was chaotic. The baby, now named Mira, cried endlessly, her tiny lungs proving surprisingly powerful. Arjun paced the living room, gently rocking her in his arms, while Anjali prepared yet another bottle of formula.</p><p>“I don’t think we’re doing this right,” Arjun said, his voice tinged with worry.</p><p>Anjali walked over, her tired smile filled with reassurance. “We’re learning. And she already thinks you’re her hero.”</p><p>Arjun looked down at Mira, who had quieted in his arms. Her eyes, wide and curious, seemed to search his face. He kissed her forehead gently. “I’ll do my best, little one,” he murmured.</p><p></p><p>Days turned into weeks, and their lives found a new rhythm. Mira’s first smile lit up their world, and her giggles became the sweetest melody in their home. Arjun became a diaper-changing expert, boasting about his speed and precision, while Anjali mastered the art of swaddling Mira so snugly she looked like a tiny burrito.</p><p>One rainy afternoon, as Mira napped on the couch, Anjali and Arjun sat together, flipping through her baby book. The pages were already filled with pictures: Mira’s first bath, her first time meeting grandparents, and the moment she clutched a soft toy rabbit they had gifted her.</p><p>Anjali traced a picture with her finger. “It’s amazing how someone so small can change everything.”</p><p>“She’s our forever,” Arjun replied, his voice soft.</p><p></p><p>Years passed in a blur of milestones. Mira’s first steps, her first words, her first day at school. Through every scraped knee and bedtime story, Anjali and Arjun were there, holding her hand, cheering her on.</p><p>On Mira’s 18th birthday, the family gathered to celebrate. Anjali and Arjun watched as their daughter, now a confident young woman, laughed with her friends. Later that evening, Mira hugged them tightly and said, “I wouldn’t be who I am without you two. You’ve given me everything.”</p><p>Tears glistened in Anjali’s eyes as she replied, “You’ve given us even more, Mira. From the first hug to forever, you’ve been our greatest gift.”</p><p></p><p>That night, as Mira left for a party with her friends, Anjali and Arjun sat together, reminiscing. The baby book was now a memory chest, filled with trinkets from Mira’s childhood: a lock of her hair, her hospital bracelet, and her first pair of tiny shoes.</p><p>“She’s grown so much,” Arjun said, his voice tinged with nostalgia.</p><p>Anjali leaned her head on his shoulder. “But some things never change. She’ll always be our baby.”</p><p>As they sat there, holding hands, the love that started from a tiny bundle in their arms continued to fill their hearts, reminding them that some bonds truly last a lifetime.</p><p></p></body></html>
